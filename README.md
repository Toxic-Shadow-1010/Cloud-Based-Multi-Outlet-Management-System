# Cloud-Based Multi-Outlet Management System

## Overview

The **Cloud-Based Multi-Outlet Management System** is a comprehensive solution designed to streamline operations for businesses with multiple outletsâ€”such as supershops and restaurants. The system centralizes inventory management, order processing, and customer data across all outlets, offering real-time updates and robust analytics. This project integrates core software engineering principles with distributed database management systems (DDMS) and a structured software development process (SDP).

## Motivation

This project aims to address key operational challenges faced by multi-outlet businesses:
- **Operational Efficiency:** Enable real-time data synchronization across outlets.
- **Informed Decision-Making:** Provide accurate analytics for inventory, sales, and customer trends.
- **Academic & Research Value:** Serve as a platform with strong potential for academic publication and support for higher studies (MSc in USA).
- **Entrepreneurial Opportunity:** Develop a market-ready product appealing to entrepreneurs looking for scalable, cloud-based management solutions.

## Features
